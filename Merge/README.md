OculusPaintPrototype - Merge
====================

Tech spike for OculusPaint. The OculusPaint project is broken up by agents; Kinect, Oculus, and Master. The Kinect agent deals with grabbing the needed Kinect information and sending it to Master Agent. The Master Agent currently only forwards information from the Kinect to the Oculus, in later versions more will be done. The Oculus Agent takes information from the Master agent and displays it for the user.

Note: Currently you need all 3 agent running, with both a Kinect and Oculus cunnected in order to run the program.

Note2: For the Kinect agent run file SkeletonGrabber.cs.
