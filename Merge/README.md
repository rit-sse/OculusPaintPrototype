OculusPaintPrototype - Merge
====================

Tech spike for OculusPaint. OculusPaint uses a Master Agent Architecture. The agents are; Kinect, Oculus, and Master. The Kinect agent deals with grabbing the needed Kinect information and sending it to Master Agent. The Master Agent currently only forwards information from the Kinect to the Oculus, in later versions it will store the current state of the program. The Oculus Agent takes information from the Master agent and displays it for the user.

Note: For the Kinect agent run file SkeletonGrabber.cs.
